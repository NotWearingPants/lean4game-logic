### `and_intro : P -> Q -> P ∧ Q`
`and_intro` is a function with two parameters. It takes two disparate pieces of evidence and combines them into a single piece of evidence. If `(e₁ : P)` and `(e₂ : Q)` are evidence, then
```
have h : P ∧ Q := and_intro e₁ e₂

# Or Elimination
If you can conclude something from `A` and you can conclude the same thing from `B`, then if you know `A ∨ B` it won't matter which of the two happens as you can still guarantee something.

or_elim is also evidence:
```
or_elim : (P ∨ Q) → (P → R) → (Q → R) → R`
```
# Parameters
`or_elim` has three parameters:
1. takes evidence for a disjunction,
2. evidence an implication on the left,
3. evidence for an implication on the right.
# Example
`or_elim` is your first 3-parameter function.

# Propositional Equivalence
`P ↔ Q` means that `P` and `Q` must have the same truth value. This is often said as “`P` if and only iff `Q`” or “`P` is logically equivalent to `Q`”.

`iff_intro` is the way to prove a biconditional like `P ↔ Q`. It requires you to show evidence for both `P → Q` and `Q → P`.

def modus_ponens {P Q : Prop} (hpq: P → Q) (p: P) : Q := hpq p

/--
In this game, the deductive rule *modus_ponens* is just function application.
```
intro h : A ∧ B
have a : A := and_left h
-- could be written as
have a : A := modus_ponens and_left h
```
and
```
intro a : A
intro b : B
have h : A ∧ B := and_intro a b
-- could be written as
have h : A ∧ B := modus_ponens (modus_ponens and_intro a) b
```

You should never use this style of prefix `modus_ponens` and just use function application instead as that will generally be clearer.

----
# Infix Modus Ponens
There is are infix operators for function application; they look like `|>` and `<|`. `f <| x`, and `x |> f` means the same as the same as `f x`.

`<|` parses `x` with lower precedence, which means that `f <| g $ <|` is interpreted as `(f (g x))` rather than `((f g) x)`.

It's twin, `|>` chains such that `x |> f |> g` is interpreted as `g (f x)`.

What makes the infix operators useful is that they can often replace a pair of brackets `(...)` making expressions easier to read.

----
# Computer Science
If you've done some programming before, you might recognise `Modus Ponens` as the identity function for implications. So `(modus_ponens and_left)` is extensionally equal to `and_left`. There's a conspiracy at work here!

# → is transitive
`P → Q` and `Q → R` implies `P → R`
```

Of course, because of `and_comm`, you know you can flip this around too.
`Q → R` and `P → Q` implies `P → R` has a near-identical proof.

### Infix Operator:
`imp_trans` has an infix operator. This looks like `≫` (which is written as “`\gg`”).

For the math-inclined, because the expression for an implication is a function, you can also use function composition for the same purpose (`∘` is written as “`\o`”). Just remember that `∘` has the parameters swapped from the way `imp_trans` is defined.
