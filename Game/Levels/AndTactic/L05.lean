# Rinse and Repeat
When you were writing expressions before, level 4 needed `and_left` while level 5 needed `and_right`. Tactics can incorporate an arbitrary amount of automation. In this case, because `assumption` will do a search through your assumptions for you, your proof for this level can be 100% identical to the one you used in the last level.
