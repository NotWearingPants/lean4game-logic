Introduction "
# Coupled Conditionals
Sybeth and Alarfil are a couple. In effect, this means that if Sybeth is playing a party game, then Alarfil is playing too and vice versa. Therefore Sybeth is playing Charades if and only if Alarfil playing.
# Proposition Key:
- J — Alarfil is playing Charades
- S — Sybeth is playing Charades
# Unlocked `↔ intro`
Assuming `e₁ : P → Q` and `e₂ : Q → P`, you can introduce a biconditional with `have h := iff_intro e₁ e₂`, though the anonymous constructor syntax works just like it does for conjunctions: `have h : P ↔ Q := ⟨e₁, e₂⟩`
