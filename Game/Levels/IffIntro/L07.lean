Introduction "
# BOSS LEVEL
This is an involved level. It doesn't require you to do anything tricky, but there are a lot of moving parts and it is easy to lose track of what you're doing.\\
\\
I recommend editor mode. Think about what this is asking you to prove and use `have` to give yourself any auxiliary facts that don't exist under your theorems.
