Introduction "
# The `repeat` tactic combinator
Sometimes you'll find you need to use the same tactic a few times in a row. Any tactic can be repeated (until it fails) using the `repeat`.\\
\\
In this level, it's very likely that you'll be building a conjunction from two assumptions already available in your proof state. Once you make it that far, instead of writing
```
constructor
assumption
assumption
```
try this instead
```
constructor
repeat assumption
```
