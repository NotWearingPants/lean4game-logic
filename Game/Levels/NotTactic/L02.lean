Introduction "
# Contradiction
This level introduces a relatively powerful tactic. Contradiction is a finishing tactic that will look through your assumptions and discharge some of the more obvious contradictions in order to solve any goal.\\
\\
examples:
  1. `h : False` says `h` is evidence for `False` which is a contradiction
  2. `h₁ : P` and `h₂ : ¬P` says that P is true and not true at the same time. This is also a contradiction.
