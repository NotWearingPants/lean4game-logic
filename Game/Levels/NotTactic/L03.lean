Introduction "
# exfalso
`exfalso` is **Contradiction**'s younger brother. Using `exfalso` turns your goal to `False`. This is the same thing as using `apply false_elim`. Using the principle that “from nonsense, follows nonsense,” if you spot a contradiction in your assumptions, you can make progress by changing your goal to `False.`\\
\\
Remember that because `¬P` is the same as `P → False`, you can use the `apply` tactic on evidence for `¬P`
